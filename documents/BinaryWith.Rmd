**Assumptions**

Suppose that random variables of the numbers of response observed in treatment and control group for PoC study are denoted by $y_t$ and $y_c$ where we assume $y_i \sim Bin(n_i,\pi_i)$ and $\pi_i \sim Beta(\alpha_i,\beta_i)$ for $i \in \{c,t\}$.

Let $x_t$ and $x_c$ be random variables of the number of response observed in treatment and control group for pivotal study.
Assume $x_i \sim Bin(m_i, \pi_i)$ for $i \in \{c,t\}$ where $m_i$ is the corresponding sample size in pivotal study.

**Go/NoGo Decision Making**

Using posterior probability, then a Go decision will be made, if 
$$P(\theta>\theta_{TV}|y_t,y_c) \geq \gamma_1,$$
where $\theta_{TV}$ is a target value representing the smallest treatment effect that would be an unequivocal efficacy signal to pursue development.
And a No Go decision will be made, if
$$P(\theta>\theta_{MAV}|y_t,y_c) \leq \gamma_2,$$
where $\theta_{MAV}$ is a minimum acceptable value representing the smallest treatment effect that would be considered clinically meaningful.

Using predictive probability, a Go decision will be made, if
$$P(\hat \theta>\theta_{null}|y_t,y_c) \geq \gamma_1,$$
where $\hat\theta$ is the treatment effect of pivotal study and $\theta_{null}$ is a value representing the smallest treatment effect that indicates a successful pivotal study.
And a No Go decision will be made, if
$$P(\hat \theta>\theta_{null}|y_t,y_c) \leq \gamma_2.$$
Calculating the posterior predictive probability involves the distribution of two independent random variables that follow beta-binomial distribution.
We use Monte Carlo simulation to approximate this probability.
The user should specify the number of simulations to run.

**Operating Characteristic**

Probability of making Go/NoGo decision will be calculated with assumed response rate.
A graph summary of probabilities will be provided, together with a table summary of probabilities given certain assumed response rates.
The user can specify those assumed response rates in "Selected values for $\pi_t$", using comma to separate values.
