**Assumptions**
Suppose that $y_{t1},\dots, y_{t n_t}$ and  $y_{c1},\dots, y_{c n_c}$ are independent observations of treatment and control group (if any) in PoC study, respectively.
We assume that $y_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_i,\sigma_i^2)$ for $i \in \{c,t\}$ and $j=1,...,n_i$.

- Non-informative prior: $p(\mu,\sigma^2) \propto \sigma^{-2}$;

- Conjugate prior of Normal-Inverse-$\chi^2$ (N-Inv-$\chi^2$): 
$\mu |\sigma^2 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_0,\sigma^2/k_0)$ and $\sigma^2 \sim \text{Inv-}\chi^2(\nu_0,\sigma_0^2)$.

**Go/NoGo Decision Making**

Using posterior probability, then a Go decision will be made, if 
$$P(\theta>\theta_{TV}|y_t) \geq \gamma_1,$$
where $\theta_{TV}$ is a target value representing the smallest treatment effect that would be an unequivocal efficacy signal to pursue development.
And a No Go decision will be made, if
$$P(\theta>\theta_{MAV}|y_t) \leq \gamma_2,$$
where $\theta_{MAV}$ is a minimum acceptable value representing the smallest treatment effect that would be considered clinically meaningful.

Using predictive probability, a Go decision will be made, if
$$P(\hat \theta>\theta_{null}|y_t) \geq \gamma_1,$$
where $\hat\theta$ is the treatment effect of pivotal study and $\theta_{null}$ is a value representing the smallest treatment effect that indicates a successful pivotal study.
And a No Go decision will be made, if
$$P(\hat \theta>\theta_{null}|y_t) \leq \gamma_2.$$
Calculating the posterior predictive probability involves the distribution of two independent random variables that follow beta-binomial distribution.
We use Monte Carlo simulation to approximate this probability.
The user should specify the number of simulations to run.

**Operating Characteristic**

Probability of making Go/NoGo decision will be calculated with assumed response rate.
A graph summary of probabilities will be provided, together with a table summary of probabilities given certain assumed response rates.
The user can specify those assumed response rates in "Selected values for $\pi_t$", using comma to separate values.
