Evidence-based decision-making is essential across all phases of clinical development.
Particularly, phase II proof-of-concept (PoC) studies play a significant role as a gatekeeper to increase the efficiency of asset selection for late-stage development by guiding decisions of stopping the development of ineffective assets as early as possible and of accelerating the development of promising assets. 
Quantitative decision-making (QDM) assessment for the phase II PoC study triggers the cross functional discussion of go/no-go decision criteria, which is indeed a key component when developing the entire clinical development plan.

Our focus is the study design we often see in cell \& gene therapy area where the cohorts to be utilized for the QDM assessment are typically small and insufficiently informative for clinical endpoints when used alone.
As such, results from the QDM assessment are difficult to interpret with very high probability of inconclusive decision. 
In addition, certain approximations that are appropriate for PoC studies with moderate to large sizes may be questionable in small studies.

Borrowing information from external data sources can be a potential solution to make the QDM more viable. For example, we may incorporate the information from the dose-escalation cohorts to augment the phase II cohort data. Besides, historical information may serve as external controls in the QDM, if available. 

We implement the Bayesian QDM methods in this App.
